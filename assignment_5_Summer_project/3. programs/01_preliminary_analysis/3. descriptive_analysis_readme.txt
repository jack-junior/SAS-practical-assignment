README – Descriptive Analysis

1. Objective
The descriptive analysis summarizes:
1. Baseline characteristics of patients by attrition status at week 12 (T12) and week 24 (T24).
2. Transition patterns of patients between states (T0→T12 and T12→T24).

2. Dataset
- Source: data_SP.data_main_clean_imputed
- Population: Patients included after baseline filtering.
- States defined:
  - A = Active/Available
  - F = Functional attrition (no assessment)
  - D = Death

3. Steps of Analysis

 3.1 Baseline Characteristics
- Continuous variables (age, fact_bl, hads_pt_anx_bl, hads_pt_dep_bl, n12) summarized using PROC MEANS.
- Categorical variables (sex, ecogps, tumrtyp, arm, ptmargstat, race1) analyzed using PROC FREQ with Chi-square tests.
- Combined descriptive table produced with PROC TABULATE.
- Results stratified by state_t12 and state_t24.

 3.2 Transition Analysis
- Transition tables constructed with PROC FREQ:
  - T0 → T12
  - T12 → T24
- Each transition cell reports count and row percentage.
- Visualization performed with PROC SGPANEL (heatmap of transitions).

4. Outputs
1. Tables of baseline characteristics by attrition status at T12 and T24.
2. Transition tables (counts and row percentages).
3. Heatmap showing patient flows between states.

5. Notes
- Percentages in transitions correspond to row percentages.
- Heatmap highlights transition intensity (counts) with labels showing both count and overall proportion.
